  style="margin-left:30px; margin-top:7px;" /> I am Bharat Balegere (ಭರತ್ ಬಳೆಗೆರೆ), an Engineer living in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore" target="_blank">Bangalore</a> (ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು), the capital of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka" target="_blank">Karnataka</a> (ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ). Karnataka is a state in South West India.
  I used work at a Financial Firm as a Technologist. I am now doing the two year full-time Post-Graduate Programme at Indian Institute of Management Bangalore.

  I am a part time blogger and I blog about computers and technology at <a href="http://agnipulse.com" target="_blank">AgniPulse.com</a>.

<h2>Technology Enthusiast</h2>
<blockquote>A person who enjoys using computers and electronic equipment. Enthusiasts like technology and are willing to learn more of the ins and outs of a product than the average consumer, who just wants to use it. </blockquote>
<p>
I love using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software" target="_blank">FOSS</a> software. I started using <a href="http://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> as my primary operating when I was in 11th standard. Later I switched to <a href="http://linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a>. I also use <a href="http://scilab.in/" target="_blank">Scilab</a> and <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>. Scilab is an alternative to Matlab and I started using it in my 3rd year of engineering to try out the some Digital Signal Processing code at home. In the same year I started using LaTeX to create my Project Reports.
