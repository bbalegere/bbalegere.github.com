title: RakshaKey - YubiKey Clone using V-USB and Atmega8
tab: projects
---

<p>RakshaKey is a USB HID Device which simulates a keyboard and types in a One Time Password based on the <a href="http://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey/technical-description/" target="_blank">YubiKey Algorithm</a>. </p>

<p>This project is an educational project and cannot replace your existng yubikey. You will have to setup your authenticating server to authenticate the the One Time passwords generated by RakshaKey</p>

<p> The OTP generating code is based on <a href="https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-c" target="_blank">YubiKey C low-level library</a> which I ported to atmega8 using V-USB</p>
<p> The Validation server is based on <a href="https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-val" target="_blank">yubikey-val</a> </p>

<p>This device was built using an Atmega8 microcontroller and <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html" target="_blank">V-USB firmware</a>. V-USB is a software only implementation of UBS 1.1. The entire code was written in C and compiled with avr-gcc.<a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/usbasploader.html" target="_blank">USBAspLoader</a> was used to program the microcontroller.
